For me, the course looks interesting and challenging and important as a beginner. I am looking forward to the advanced and serious contents of it. During this course, I expect I will learn how to use free software tools such as **R-studio** and **GitHub** and how they can be used to analyze datasets. In addition, I expect to learn how these software can be used for reproducible data analysis.
I knew about this course through university course page for doctoral students. The link to my GitHub repository is attached here:
