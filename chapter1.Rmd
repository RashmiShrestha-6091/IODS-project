For me, the course looks interesting and challenging and important for me. I am looking forward to the advanced and serious contents of it. During this course, I expect I will learn how to use R-studio and GitHub and how they can be used to analyze big datasets. I knew about the course through university course page for doctoral students. The link to my GitHub repository is attached here:
